# Executive summary
Executive summaries are documents that collect the most important points contained in a longer plan or report. These summaries are common across a wide variety of businesses, giving decision makers a brief overview of the most relevant information. They can also be used to help new team members become acquainted with the details of a project quickly. The format is designed to respect the responsibilities of decision makers and/or executives who may not have time to read and understand an entire report.
