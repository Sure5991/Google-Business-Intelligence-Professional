# Bias in Data Analysis
There are several types of biases that an analyst can deal with in regular life
* Confirmation bias
* Selection bias
* Historical bias
* Outlier bias

## Confirmation bias
Confirmation bias occurs when an analyst is either exploring or trying to interpret data to confirm with their prior beliefs.record all prior beliefs and assumptions before starting analysis to actually be cognizant of the fact that one do have these preconceived notions about the data or the process
## Selection bias
Selection bias can occur when we are dealing with samples which are not representative of the entire population.This can happen organically when we're dealing with small datasets or when the randomization process has not happened. to use highly randomized set of data to actually use data which might be more representative of the analysis than being just convenient
## Historical bias
Historical data bias happens when sociocultural prejudices and beliefs are mirrored into systematic processes. To gather more data and do more research about the opposite side of your hypothesis
## Outlier bias
Averages are a great way to hide anomalies and outliers while skewing our observation. To be cognizant of outliers when the average analysis  are looking good in the data
